# Netflix_SQL
This is a project I did for Database design and development of web applications course at Pace University. 

./Database Export/Netflix_Export - This is the main database export file for dummy Netflix database.  
./Queries/*.sql - These are queries for table creation, data insert as well as queries performed for the project for those who want to try this from scratch.  
./Screenshots/ - All the screenshots of tables and results of queries.
